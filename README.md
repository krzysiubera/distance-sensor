# distance-sensor
The purpose of this project was to create a distance sensor based on FRDM-KL05Z board. Components used in this project:
- FRDM-KL05Z board:

## How it works
To start measurement, you need to supply a short 10 us pulse to the trigger input. This pin has been configured in mode 'edge-aligned PWM low-true pulses (set output on match,
clear output on reload)' to achieve mentioned task. After that, impulse appears on the echo input. Pulse width is proportional to measured distance. To measure it, echo pin has
been configured in mode 'input capture, capture on rising and falling edge'. A distance is displayed on the LCD display, in centimeters.
